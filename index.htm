            <h2>Introducing The Question</h2>
            <p>
                On the surface, plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) seem like the natural progression of logistics
                technology. The idea of never again having to buy gasoline, never again having to pay for a tune-up,
                never again having to worry if your car will start this morning because of the snow and ice&hellip; it almost
                sounds too good to be true. Cynics and skeptics decry these statements as overly simplistic, doubting
                the claims made by the automotive companies producing the vehicles and dismissing reports from users as
                being the result of the early part of the hype cycle [1]. But as with most truly hard problems, it's not
                even as simple as the cynic and skeptic make it out to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analysis of the full lifecycle of PEVs&mdash;from the mining of resources such as lithium to the
                disposal of the same resources after the vehicle is no longer usable&mdash;reveals that significant
                pollution and toxic chemicals are released over the course of the vehicle's full lifecycle [2, 3].
                However, previous comparisons of this more realistic calculation to the economic and environmental cost
                of purchasing a conventional internal combustion engive vehicle (ICEV) have often either left off the
                same scrutiny for the ICEV, or have manipulated the input values for their model so as to make the PEV
                appear worse for the environment [3, 4, 5]. This issue is only exacerbated by popular science media, who
                often take a publication at face value without giving critical investigation to the methodologies used
                in the research [3, 5].
