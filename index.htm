            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                On the surface, plug-in battery electric vehicles (EV) seem like the natural progression of logistics
                technology. The idea of never again having to buy gasoline, never again having to pay for a tune-up,
                never again having to worry if your car will start this morning because of the snow and ice&hellip; it
                almost sounds too good to be true. Cynics and skeptics decry these statements as overly simplistic,
                doubting the claims made by the automotive companies producing the vehicles and dismissing reports of
                gargantuan savings from their owners as being the result of the early part of the hype cycle [1]. But as
                with most truly hard problems, it's not even as simple as the cynic and skeptic make it out to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analysis of the full life cycle of EVs&mdash;from the mining of resources such as lithium to the
                disposal of the same resources after the vehicle is no longer usable&mdash;reveals that significant
                pollution and toxic chemicals are released over the course of the vehicle's full existence [2, 3].
                However, the production of conventional vehicles (CV) is equally damaging, with estimates putting the
                carbon footprint of producing a single new vehicle at almost the same amount as the carbon released from
                powering a typical home in the UK for three years [4]. Analyzing the production processes of EVs and CVs
                to determine which is more damaging asks a different question than is asked in this study, and as such
                the na&iuml;ve approach has been taken, comparing only the costs the consumer faces&mdash;the initial
                purchase price, the cost of fuel, and the cost of scheduled maintenance&mdash;and fixing the pre- and
                post-consumer costs as being essentially equivalent, reserving the true analysis thereof for another
                day.
            </p>

            <h2>Worst Case Scenario</h2>
            <p>
                Without a doubt, a comparable EV is more expensive than its CV counterpart, and this is almost
                completely due to the batteries present in the EV. In the following chart, the base sticker prices of
                two comparable vehicles&mdash;one EV and one CV&mdash;are compared at simple face value, without any
                dealer, local, regional, or federal discounts applied:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <div id="chart1"></div>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                    Comparison of dealer sticker price without any discounts or credits
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Starting with this as a base point, the estimated total cost of ownership (TCO) over the life of each
                vehicle can be calculated by adding all lifetime expenses to the initial purchase price to compare the
                worst case scenario of there being no dealer or manufacturer discounts and no local or federal tax
                credits for the purchase of the EV. Data on the topic of vehicle maintenance costs are routinely
                collected by the consumer advocacy group Consumer Reports, which surveys thousands of their subscribers
                every year about the reliability and maintenance requirements of their vehicles and appliances [5].
                Harto performed detailed analysis of the survey responses of both EV and CV from survey years 2019 and
                2020 to arrive at the following data [5]:

                This data was used to estimate the potential maintenance requirements of the two vehicles considered. A
                lifetime distance traveled value of 200,000 miles was selected as the end-of-life figure, and using
                similar methodologies presented by Harto [5], the estimated maintenance costs can be added to the
                initial purchase price:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <div id="chart2"></div>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                    Comparison of the initial purchase price combined with the estimated lifetime maintenance cost
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Maintenance cost reduction, while significant, is not the main benefit that is touted with regard to EV
                adoption, and is likely not significantly responsible for the rapid growth of the non-commercial EV
                fleet, even if it plays a more significant part in EV adoption in the commercial sector. Fuel cost
                savings are what is generally regarded as the single greatest benefit that EV have over CV. The U.S.
                Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates the average combined miles per gallon (MPG) of the base
                model 2021 Nissan LEAF to be 111 MGP equivalent [6], whereas the Nissan Sentra from the same year
                received an estimated average combined MPG rating of 33 [7]. The estimated average annual fuel cost,
                which uses a value of 15,000 miles as the distance traveled in one year, is given as $600 and $1,450 for
                the LEAF and Sentra, respectively [8]. With these values, it is simple to deduce the estimated lifetime
                fuel cost for each vehicle using the following formula:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="./assets/images/formula.png" alt="" width="275" />
            </div>
            <p>
                where <code>x<sub>fe</sub></code> is the total fuel expense for the given vehicle, and
                <code>x<sub>ac</sub></code> is the EPA annual cost of fuel for the vehicle. With these values
                calculated, they can then be added as a third value in the comparison between the two vehicles:
            </p>
